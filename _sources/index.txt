This document describes the PyGAS extension to the Python programming language. PyGAS aims to maximize programmer productivity by combining the benefits of:

* Python_'s concise syntax,
* The `Single Program Multiple Data`_ execution model, and
* The `Partitioned Global Address Space`_ memory model.

To get started with PyGAS, check out the `Tutorial` and `Example Programs`.
