% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference, compsocconf]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsocconf option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

High-level, productivity-oriented languages such as Python have becoming increasingly popular as ``glue code'' in HPC applications. The PGAS model offers its own productivity advantages, and combining PGAS and Python is a promising approach for rapid development of parallel applications. We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of a PGAS extension to Python, and we present initial performance results from a prototype implementation called PyGAS.

Like other productivity-oriented languages, Python offers significant productivity advantages over its low-level cousins like Fortan and C.  Python's concise syntax, interactivity, and dynamic language features enable rapid prototyping of new algorithms and workflows. Furthermore, its vast libraries that comprise powerful scientific toolkits, and its low-level API allows for optimization where appropriate. Python is increasingly used to drive parallel applications and mediate between their components. The PGAS model, with is own productivity advantanges, is a natural choice for parallel programming in Python. This abstract explores the major design considerations that may arise when extending Python with a partitioned global address space. We present a prototype implementation and discuss its implications for productivity and performance.

We are interested in extending Python for several reasons. First, we aim for interoperability with existing existing code libraries, thereby enabling their use in a PGAS environment. Second, we hope to lower the programming model's barrier to entry by making as few changes to syntax and semantics as possible. We expect that programmers familiar with Python will be able to introduce PGAS constructs into their serial programs with relative ease.

\section{PyGAS: A PGAS Python Prototype}
We have developed a prototype implementation of a PGAS extension to Python which we call PyGAS. PyGAS implements all PGAS logic in a library and therefore requires no modification to the CPython interpreter. The library is built on the GASNet Communication Library \cite{gasnet}, so PyGAS programs can target shared or distributed memory machines. PyGAS is designed for the single program, multiple data (SPMD) execution model, which has been established as the predominant model for massively parallel programs. We currently run one interpreter per thread of execution in the SPMD job.

The primary PyGAS primitive for representing shared entities is the Proxy object.\footnote{The PyGAS Proxy was inspired by the Proxy object in the PyRO library \cite{pyro}, which implements remote operations on objects in a distributed system.} Proxies are initialized with an original object, and subsequent operations on the Proxy are intercepted by Python's attribute resolution system, dispatched over the network, and executed on the original object. This behavior is consistent with Python's duck-typing system: the Proxy `quacks' like the original object, so it can be treated as such. For those familiar with UPC, the Proxy can be viewed as a {\it pointer-to-shared} containing the owner's rank and the address of the original object within the owner's memory space. To exploit locality, the program can query a Proxy's owner and branch accordingly. Finally, Proxies themselves are objects, so Proxies-to-Proxies can be constructed (analogous to UPC's {\it shared-pointer-to-shared}).

A method call on Proxy is executed on the thread with affinity to the original object, regardless of which thread called the method. This behavior is a departure from UPC- and Titanium-like ``caller computes'' semantics, but is necessary in the light of dynamic code generation because the remote method may differ from local versions with the same name.
%PyGAS requires two round-trips to call a shared object's method: one to resolve the method name into a bound method object and another to evaluate the method. Both the arguments and the return value are serialized as they as sent to and from the owner.


\section{Implementation Challenges}
Python was not design for parallelism, so naturally some challenges are when extending it with PGAS functionality.
 
\subsection{The Global Interpreter Lock}
Python's reference implementation uses a ``big lock'' that must be held while performing any language-level operations. The Global Interpreter Lock or GIL, as it's called, prevents true multithreading in programs. Fortunately, there are ways to exploit on-chip parallelism. Performance-oriented libraries can be internally multithreaded if their operations are independent of the interpreter. For example, the numerical package Numpy can use a multithreaded BLAS implementation. Alternatively, PGAS extension libraries could be built on Python implementations that don't possess a global lock, such as the JVM-based Jython \cite{jython}; however, other implementations offer limited interoperability with mainline packages.

Big locks like the GIL also complicate the use of Active-Message-based communication libraries like GASNet. When message handlers are invoked upon message receipt, the interrupted thread often holds the big lock, preventing the handler from safely performing language-level operations. As a workaround, PyGAS handlers register secondary functions with the interpreter that are called asynchronously with the lock, incurring a moderate performance penalty.

\subsection{Automatic Memory Management}
Python's automatic memory management system provides significant productivity advantages, but implementing garbage collection schemes efficiently in a distributed environment remains a challenge. Python uses reference counting, so a PyGAS must keep accurate tallies of references from both local objects and remote Proxies. We plan to implement a scheme wherein Proxies could decrement remote counts when they themselves are garbage-collected, at the expense of extra communication.

\subsection{Object serialization}
Serialization is a necessary step for communicating arbitrary objects. Currently, PyGAS uses Python's general purpose serialization module {\tt pickle}, which generates a platform-independent object representation. In practice, PyGAS doesn't require such portability because parallel machines usually have uniform processor architecture. We expect to achieve moderate speedups by writing a custom serializer that disregards portability concerns.


\section{Performance and Productivity Assessment}
Initial results indicate that PyGAS provides substantial productivity advantages while maintaining performance comparable to {\tt mpi4py} \cite{mpi4py}, the most popular MPI bindings for Python. Figure \ref{fig_bw} shows the bandwidth attainable during a remote read operation between two CPython 2.7.3 interpreters running on separate nodes of Carver \cite{carver}, an IBM iDataPlex machine with 2.67 GHz Intel Nehalem cores and 32 Gb/s Infiniband interconnect links. The performance is weak compared to UPC: PyGAS achieves 10\% of the bandwidth seen by a UPC implementation of the same microbenchmark. However, PyGAS achieves more than double the performance of the MPI bindings for large messages when using the same serialization routines.
%The faster MPI variant exploits the ability of some objects to store data in a contiguous memory buffer, but it is not applicable to general objects.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics{bandwidth.eps}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{The average bandwidth attained during a remote read operation. Both the PyGAS variant and the ``pickle'' {\tt mpi4py} variant use the same serialization method. The ``buffer'' {\tt mpi4py} variant avoids serialization of Python objects that store data in a contiguous region of memory, but this optimization is not generally applicable.}
\label{fig_bw}
\end{figure}

We also implemented Cannon's algorithm for distributed matrix multiplication in PyGAS, in Python with {\tt mpi4py}, and in C with MPI. Both Python codes required roughly 50\% fewer lines of code than the C+MPI variant and the code complexity was considerably reduced. All three codes exhibited roughly the same performance on four nodes of Carver, with the C variant being about 10\% faster.

%Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or Times New Roman may be used. If neither is available on your system, please use the font closest in appearance to Times. Avoid using bit-mapped fonts if possible. True-Type 1 or Open Type fonts are preferred. Please embed symbol fonts, as well, for math, etc.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}
Existing high-level languages are viable candidates for PGAS extensions, even in light of moderate challenges to overcome in their design and implementation. In Python's case, PyGAS provides substantial productivity advantages at the price of moderate performance loss. Such performance may be tolerable in a rapid prototyping environment, and the savings in development cost may justify the use of PyGAS.
